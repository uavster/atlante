Atlante
=======
Atlante is a cross-platform (Linux/Windows) library for:
- Linear algebra
- Multi-threading
- High resolution timers
- String manipulation

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: I have recently added some thread synchronization functionalities that only work on Linux. So, if you are developing on Windows, please handle with care.
